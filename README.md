VideoScript is a collection of video processes including video **Upscale** and video frame **Interpolation**, it uses Python to generate **FFmpeg**, **Real-ESRGAN** and **IFRNet** command line script and performes serial processing on scanned **mp4**/**mkv** videos.

VideoScriptWebUI is a local web user interface developed with **Dash**, it has the goal of enhancing user experience.

## Embedded version

Simplest. Python, Tools are already setup.  
Advantage : **Beginner-friendly**

### Installation

1. Download and extract the [Embedded release](https://github.com/luewh/Video-Script/releases/latest)

### Usage

- Run the `RUN.bat` to launch WebUI



## Self setup version

Need to install Python dependencies, add tools to PATH manually.  
Advantage : **Freedom**

### Installation

1. Download and extract the [SelfSetup release](https://github.com/luewh/Video-Script/releases/latest)

2. Download and install Python 3.10 if you dont have.

3. Install dependencies

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
 
4. Add tools to PATH

    Below tools are included in self setup release :

    [FFmpeg](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/) full build for hardware acceleration.

    [Real-ESRGAN-ncnn-vulkan](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN-ncnn-vulkan/releases) for video upscaling.
    
    [Ifrnet-ncnn-vulkan](https://github.com/nihui/ifrnet-ncnn-vulkan/releases) for video frame interpolation.  
    
    <span style="color:orange">**Important**</span>  

    Make sure to add  

    - `<pathTo>\ffmpeg-full_build\bin`
    - `<pathTo>\Real-ESRGAN`
    - `<pathTo>\Ifrnet`

    in the environment variable *PATH*



### Usage

- VideoScript.py

    Run the script on where videos are located and follow the command line indication

- VideoScriptWebUI.py

    Run the script, a web page should be opened automatically, select a process, select a path where videos are located, **SCAN** then **RUN**. The processed videos are under a folder of selected path example ./upscaled.



## Processes Description

- optimize

    Reduce the video biteRate in order to gain storage space.  
    The processed videos will have a bitRate = width * height * quality, which quality=3 is generally the lowest value before appearance of artifacts (bad images, blurry...). In other words, humain wont notice the visual difference between video of quality 3 and 6.

- resize

    Reduce the video width and height.

- upscale

    Recover old video from 360p to 4K, enhance video quality.  
    Begin with a transformation of video to image frames, then upscale each frames, finally reassemble to video.   
    It has the ability to start from last upscal progress if the "_upscaled_frame" wasn't deleted.

- interpolate

    Increase video frame rate (FPS), smooth video motions.  
    Begin with a transformation of video to image frames, then interpolate between frames, finally reassemble to video.

- merge

    Merge all video, including each of its audio and subtitle by option, into mkv. Then use media player as PotPlayer to switch between video/audio/subtitle.
